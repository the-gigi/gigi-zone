I recently joined a [cool startup](https://getinvisible.com) with some awesome people!
It's unbelievable how much happened in just 4 weeks.

<!--more-->

It's not like I'm not used to small startups where everyone fits in one room. But, this was 
exceptional. I learned so much in such a short time.

Let's see...

- ♨️ [Re]learned Java - My previous Java experience was a Three months project 19 years ago
- 💜 Learned [Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) - Like Terraform, but way better...
- 🌧️ Provisioned infra on Three cloud providers: AWS, Azure and GCP
- 🤖 Evaluated different LLM providers: Anyscale, Azure OpenAI and GCP Gemini
- 🐙 Started an open-source project: [llm-playground-java](https://github.com/the-gigi/llm-playground-java)
- 💎 Contributed a couple of PRs to a cool Java library - [simple-openai](https://github.com/sashirestela/simple-openai)
- 🔥 Started this blog - [The Gigi Zone](https://the-gigi.github.io/gigi-zone)

Until next time...
