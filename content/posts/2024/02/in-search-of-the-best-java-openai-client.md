Alright. This is going to be a long one. We're going on a wild hunt for the BEST Java library to talk to OpenAI 
API-compatible services!

Everybody and their sister goes crazy about the amazing abilities of large language models. At the moment OpenAI leads
the pack in terms of performance and recognition (mostly thanks to ChatGPT). But, a lot of work is done across the board
by the open source community, commercial companies and of course the big cloud providers.

I wanted to test another LLM provider - [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com). Anyscale is mostly known for
providing a general-purpose AI platform based on [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/), but they also provide an 
[Endpoints service]() that hosts various open-source LLM foundation models.
