## 2037

Comedy club where AI standup comedian is making fun of humans worrying about C timestamp wrapping around when AI agents
translated all C code to Rust in March 2027 and by May 2027 replaced all operating systems with new ΩS (Omega System).

## AI Agents are people (at the moment)

If you recall I clained not too long ago that AI agents are not real, so how come I recognize them as people. That
appears to be the mother of all 180s. Unless... I believe that people are not real, which to a certain degree I am! But,
there is another possibility which can reconcile all three claims:

- AI agents are not real
- AI agents are people
- People are real

By slightly modifying the third claim to be *Some* people are real. So, you, me and Arnold Schwarzenegger are real (I
think), but AI agents are not real. Lots of other unreal people like fictional characters, imaginary friends and
ghosts (this is open to debate by some real people).

Ok. With that almost completely irrelevant side quest out of the way let's see why AI agents are people. First, remember
that what we call agents are actually a bundle of system prompts and tools provided to some LLM to actually do stuff.
So, we need to look at LLMs and what makes them people. Well, there a bunch of good reasons:

1.Pre-trained on human data
2.Post-trained by humans (RLHF)
3.Perform RAG (retrival augmented generation) on human data
4.Conduct conversations with humans
5.Most importantly they behave like humans (when interacting with humans)

All, but the last one will change. LLMs will be trained more and more on synthetic data or public real data that itself
was generated by LLMs. The post-training will be done by other models that better reflect human-ess (if you don't buy
that, just wait). The RAG will be done on AI generated content and AI agents will hve many more interactions with other
AI agents than with humans.

But, when talking to humans they will continue to present themselves as humans because that's what is optimal for the
human users.

OK. Cool story, bro. What your point?

Alright, let's focus on AI coding agents at the beginning of 2026 (with the pace of progress it's super important to
qualify every statement with the date). They behave like excited and super-motivated human interns. They'll hapilly stay
up all night and generate mountains of code. But, their judgment will be faulty. They'll miss the big picture. They'll
perform tasks partially. They will not exercise best practices and overall in a big project they can cause a lot of
problems without supervision.

So, are we just waiting for better models? Nope. We can teach the young intern, by providing the agents proper access to
architecture docs, establishing workflows and guardrails and enabling the agents to learn from the accumulated body of
knowledge.

## Configuration Files Considered Harmful (Sort of)

There is nothing like a good "<Blank> is considered Harmful" essay to exasperate the unwashed masses of anguished
software engineers toiling over their keyboards.

????

- Using direct Programming language structures
- Embedding configuration
- Hybrid (overrides)
- Dynamic configuration
- Env vars and command-line args

- Dishonorable mention - JSON as config

When config files shine.

- Small images
- Minimal layers
- CMD and/or ENTRYPOINT
- shell vs. exec
